https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/employee-retention-credit," The Employee Retention Credit (ERC) – sometimes called the Employee Retention Tax Credit or ERTC – is a refundable tax credit for businesses and tax-exempt organizations that had employees and were affected during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The requirements are different depending on the time period for which you claim the credit. The ERC is not available to individuals.  For more information see below and the latest frequently asked questions (FAQs). Additional FAQs and resources will be added as more information is available.  Beware of ERC scam promotions Employers should be wary of ERC advertisements that advise them to ""apply"" for money by claiming the ERC when they may not qualify. Anyone who improperly claims the credit has to pay it back and may owe penalties and interest. The only way to claim the ERC is on a federal employment tax return.  The ads are all over radio, TV and social media. You may even get ads that look like official government letters, or texts, emails and phone calls advertising ERC eligibility.  Warning signs of aggressive ERC marketing The Employee Retention Credit is a complex credit that requires careful review before applying, so be wary of:  Unsolicited ads, calls, emails or texts from someone you don't know. Statements that the promoter or company can determine your ERC eligibility within minutes. Large upfront fees to claim the credit. Fees based on a percentage of the refund amount of Employee Retention Credit claimed – you should always avoid a tax preparer basing their fee on the amount of the refund. Statements from the promoter that you qualify for the credit before any discussion about your tax situation. Statements from the promoter urging you submit the claim because there is nothing to lose. In reality, those improperly receiving the credit could have to repay the credit – along with substantial interest and penalties. These promoters may lie about eligibility requirements. In addition, those using these companies could be at risk of someone using the credit as a ploy to steal the taxpayer's identity or take a cut of the taxpayer's improperly claimed credit.  For details about ERC scams, see News Release IR-2023-105, IRS alerts businesses, tax-exempt groups of warning signs for misleading Employee Retention scams; simple steps can avoid improperly filing claims  Eligibility highlights The credit is available to eligible employers that paid qualified wages to some or all employees after March 12, 2020, and before January 1, 2022. Eligibility and credit amount vary depending on when the business impacts occurred. The ERC is not available to individuals.  Generally, businesses and tax-exempt organizations that qualify are those that:  Were shut down by a government order due to the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 or the first three calendar quarters of 2021, or Experienced the required decline in gross receipts during the eligibility periods during 2020 or the first three calendar quarters of 2021, or Qualified as a recovery startup business for the third or fourth quarters of 2021 Eligible employers must have paid qualified wages to claim the credit.  Eligible employers can claim the ERC on an original or adjusted employment tax return for a period within those dates.  For more information about eligibility and credit amounts, see the Employee Retention Credit - 2020 vs 2021 Comparison Chart.  For more details, see Frequently asked questions about the Employee Retention Credit.  Limitations Certain limitations apply to the ERC. For example, employers can't claim the ERC on wages that were reported as payroll costs for Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness. Qualified wages for purposes of the ERC do not include payroll costs in connection with shuttered venue operators grants or restaurant revitalization grants.  Definitions of eligibility terms: Notice 2021-20 Sections III.C. and III.D., Questions and Answers 10 through 22 – Suspension of operations due to orders from an appropriate governmental authority Section III.E., Questions and Answers 23 through 28 – Decline in gross receipts during 2020 Notice 2021-23 Section III.C – Decline in gross receipts during the first three calendar quarters of 2021 Notice 2021-49 Section III.D – Recovery startup business for third and fourth calendar quarters of 2021 Need help? If you need help claiming the credit or correcting your tax return, see tips for choosing a tax professional.  How to claim Eligible businesses that didn't claim the credit when they filed their original employment tax return can claim the credit by filing adjusted employment tax returns. For example, businesses that file quarterly employment tax returns can file Form 941-X, Adjusted Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return or Claim for RefundPDF, to claim the credit for prior 2020 and 2021 quarters.  Reminder: If you file Form 941-X to claim the Employee Retention Credit, you must reduce your deduction for wages by the amount of the credit for that same tax period. Therefore, you may need to amend your income tax return (for example, Forms 1040, 1065, 1120, etc.) to reflect that reduced deduction  For more information, see:  Notice 2021-20, Section III.L., Question and Answer 60 Notice 2021-49, Section IV.C., Timing of Qualified Wages Deduction Disallowance Forms and instructions To claim or correct your credit by adjusting your employment tax return, use the adjusted return and instructions that apply to your business or organization and the relevant tax period:  For employers that file quarterly:  Form 941-X, April 2023 RevisionPDF Form 941-X Instructions, April 2023 RevisionPDF Form 941 Instructions, December 2021 RevisionPDF for additional information related to the ERC for quarters in 2021 Form 941 Instructions 2020 RevisionsPDF for additional information related to the ERC for quarters in 2020 For agricultural employers:  Form 943-XPDF Form 943-X Instructions, February 2023 RevisionsPDF  Form 943 Instructions, December 2021 RevisionPDF for additional information related to the ERC for quarters in 2021 For employers that file annually:  Form 944-XPDF Form 944-X Instructions, February 2023 RevisionsPDF  Form 944 Instructions, December 2021 RevisionPDF for additional information related to the ERC for quarters in 2021 For railroad employers:  Form CT-1XPDF Form CT-1X Instructions, March 2023 RevisionsPDF  Form CT-1 Instructions, January 2022 RevisionPDF for additional information related to the ERC for quarters in 2021 Form CT-1 InstructionsPDF for additional information related to the ERC for quarters in 2020 Penalty relief Get information on penalty relief related to claims for the Employee Retention Credit.

https://www.irs.gov/faqs/irs-procedures/refund-inquiries,"Question What if I entered the correct account and routing numbers, but the IRS made an error in depositing my refund? Answer Contact an IRS customer service representative to correct any agency errors by calling 800-829-1040 (see telephone assistance for hours of operation). Unfortunately, this may result in you receiving a paper check.  Category IRS Procedures Sub-Category   Can I receive a tax refund if I am currently making payments under an installment agreement or payment plan for another federal tax period?   Answer: No, one of the conditions of your installment agreement is that the IRS will automatically apply any refund (or overpayment) due to you against taxes you owe. Because your refund isn't applied toward your regular monthly payment, continue making your installment agreement payments as scheduled.  If your refund exceeds your total balance due on all outstanding tax liabilities including accruals, you'll receive a refund of the excess unless you owe certain other past-due amounts, such as state income tax, child support, a student loan, or other federal nontax obligations which are offset against any refund. For more information on these non-IRS refund offsets, you can call the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS) at 800-304-3107 (toll-free).  Additional Information: Instructions for Form 9465, Installment Agreement Request (PDF) Subcategory: Refund Inquiries Category: IRS Procedures I lost my refund check. How do I get a new one?   Answer: If you lost your refund check, you should initiate a refund trace:  Use Where's My Refund, call us at 800-829-1954 and use the automated system, or speak with an agent by calling 800-829-1040 (see telephone assistance for hours of operation).  However, if you filed a married filing jointly return, you can’t initiate a trace using the automated systems. Download and complete the Form 3911, Taxpayer Statement Regarding RefundPDF or the IRS can send you a Form 3911 to get the replacement process started. Your claim for a missing refund is processed one of two ways:  If the check wasn't cashed, you'll receive a replacement check once the original check is canceled. If the refund check was cashed, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS) will provide you with a claim package that includes a copy of the cashed check. Follow the instructions for completing the claim package. BFS will review your claim and the signature on the canceled check before determining whether they can issue you a replacement check. The BFS review can take up to six weeks to complete. Subcategory: Refund Inquiries Category: IRS Procedures Is it possible to find out if my federal tax refund check was cashed?   Answer: Yes, if you need to know whether your federal tax refund check was cashed, you can initiate a refund trace by using one of the following methods:  Use Where's My Refund, call us at 800-829-1954 (toll-free) and use the automated system, or speak with a representative by calling 800-829-1040 (see telephone assistance for hours of operation). If you filed a married filing jointly return, you can't initiate a trace using the automated systems. The IRS will send you a Form 3911, Taxpayer Statement Regarding RefundPDF to get the process started or you can download the form. If you're trying to obtain a photocopy of your refund check because of a dispute over the proceeds, call us and speak to a representative to request assistance.  By law, the IRS can't disclose any information to you about someone else’s refund. For example, the IRS can't discuss a check issued to another taxpayer with you unless you have obtained authorization. If you submit a Form 8821, Tax Information Authorization for a person, we may provide information to you for that person’s refund.  If you lost your refund check, see I lost my refund check. How do I get a new one?  Subcategory: Refund Inquiries Category: IRS Procedures What is a split refund?   Answer: A split refund lets you divide your refund, in any proportion you want, and direct deposit the funds into up to three different accounts with U.S. financial institutions. Use Part I of Form 8888, Allocation of Refund (Including Savings Bond Purchases) to request to have your refund split. The accounts must be in your name. You may also use part or all of your refund to buy up to $5,000 in paper or electronic U.S. Series I Savings Bonds for yourself or someone else by using Part II of Form 8888.  Additional Information: Frequently Asked Questions about Splitting Federal Income Tax Refunds Subcategory: Refund Inquiries Category: IRS Procedures If I am filing a joint return with my spouse, must our refund be deposited to a jointly-held account?   Answer: You can ask the IRS to direct deposit a refund from a jointly-filed return into your account, your spouse's account, or a joint account. However, because state and financial institution rules can vary, you should first verify that your financial institution accepts a joint refund deposit into an individual account.  Subcategory: Refund Inquiries Category: IRS Procedures May I direct part or all of my refund to apply as a contribution for the prior year to my individual retirement account (IRA) on Form 8888?   Answer: Yes, but the refund must be deposited by the due date for filing your tax return (not counting extensions). In addition, IRS direct deposits of federal tax refunds won't indicate which year the IRA contribution is for. If you want all your refund deposited into your IRA, you don't use Form 8888, Allocation of Refund (Including Savings Bond Purchases); you do it on your tax return.  Ensure that your financial institution accepts deposits for the prior year to IRAs. As with all IRA deposits, the account owner is responsible for informing the IRA trustee of the year for which the deposit is intended, for ensuring that contributions don't exceed annual contribution limitations and that contributions are timely made. If you fail to notify the IRA trustee of the intended year for the deposit, the IRA trustee can assume the deposit is for the current year (for example, a refund received in 2023 is deposited as a contribution for 2023 and not for 2022).  The IRS isn't responsible for the timeliness or contribution amounts related to an IRA direct deposit.  An error on your return or an offset of your refund could change the amount of refund available for deposit (for more information, see Are there conditions that could change the amount of my refund?). You must verify the deposit amount and that the deposit was actually made to the account on time — by the due date of the return (without regard to extensions). If the deposit into your account doesn't occur by the due date of the return (without regard to extensions), the deposit is a contribution for 2023 rather than 2022, and you must file an amended 2022 return to reduce any IRA deduction and any retirement savings contributions credit you claimed for 2022 for that deposit. Additional Information: IRA FAQs  Subcategory: Refund Inquiries Category: IRS Procedures Are there conditions that could change the amount of my refund?   Answer: Yes, there are several factors that could change the amount of your tax refund - resulting in either a larger or smaller refund than expected.  Examples that could increase your refund are math errors and other mistakes on your return.  Examples that could decrease your refund include:  Math errors or mistakes; Delinquent federal taxes; State income taxes, child support, student loans or other delinquent federal nontax obligations; and When the IRS withholds a portion of your refund while further review of an item claimed on your return takes place. Subcategory: Refund Inquiries Category: IRS Procedures What should I do if I entered an incorrect routing or account number for direct deposit of my refund?   Answer: The IRS assumes no responsibility for tax preparer or taxpayer error. Please verify your account and routing numbers with your financial institution and double check the accuracy of the numbers you enter on your return prior to signing and submitting it. You should not request a deposit of your refund into an account that's not in your own name.  The IRS handles account or routing number errors the same for both split refunds and regular direct deposits.  Scenario: You omit a digit in the account or routing number of an account and the number doesn't pass the IRS's validation check. In this case, the IRS will send you a paper check for the entire refund instead of a direct deposit. You incorrectly enter an account or routing number and the number passes the validation check, but your designated financial institution rejects and returns the deposit to the IRS. The IRS will issue a paper check for the amount of that deposit once it is received. You incorrectly enter an account or routing number that belongs to someone else and your designated financial institution accepts the deposit. You must work directly with the respective financial institution to recover your funds. See the last solution bullet below. You requested a Refund Anticipation Loan (RAL) or Refund Anticipation Check (RAC) through your preparer or preparation software. Usually this occurs when you authorize the fee for preparation to be taken from your refund. Even if you didn't request a direct deposit, these types of refunds are directly deposited into the preparer’s financial institution, so you should contact that institution for resolution. See the last solution bullet below. Solution: If the return hasn't already posted to our system, you can ask us to stop the direct deposit. You may call us toll-free at 800-829-1040, M - F, 7 a.m. - 7 p.m. Generally, if the financial institution recovers the funds and returns them to the IRS, the IRS will send a paper refund check to your last known address on file with the IRS. If you have contacted the financial institution and two weeks have passed with no results, you will need to file Form 3911, Taxpayer Statement Regarding RefundPDF to initiate a trace. This allows the IRS to contact the bank on your behalf to attempt recovery of your refund. Banks are allowed up to 120 days from the date of the initial trace input to respond to our request for information. If funds aren't available or the bank refuses to return the funds, the IRS cannot compel the bank to do so. The case may then become a civil matter between you and the financial institution and/or the owner of the account into which the funds were deposited. Subcategory: Refund Inquiries Category: IRS Procedures How can I ensure my refund is deposited as I designate?   Answer: First, check with your financial institution to ensure they will accept a direct deposit for the type of account you're designating. Some financial institutions will accept direct deposits for some types of accounts, but not others. Second, make sure you use the correct routing and account numbers for the account - ask your financial institution if you're unsure - and double check the accuracy of the numbers you enter on your tax return. An incorrect or transposed number could result in your financial institution rejecting the deposit or, worse, depositing your refund into someone else's account. Third, double check your return to ensure you haven't made math or other errors that could increase or decrease the actual amount of your refund. The IRS recommends electronic filing for the most error-free return. Note: Your refund may only be deposited directly into accounts that are in your own name, your spouse's name, or both if it's a joint account. Also, no more than three electronic refunds can be directly deposited into a single financial account or prepaid debit card. Taxpayers who exceed the limit will receive an IRS notice and a paper refund.  Subcategory: Refund Inquiries Category: IRS Procedures What if I entered the correct account and routing numbers, but the IRS made an error in depositing my refund?   Answer: Contact an IRS customer service representative to correct any agency errors by calling 800-829-1040 (see telephone assistance for hours of operation). Unfortunately, this may result in you receiving a paper check.  Subcategory: Refund Inquiries Category: IRS Procedures How can I collect child support from the noncustodial parent?   Answer: If you need assistance in obtaining child support payments that are overdue, you may contact your state child-support enforcement agency or the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE). OCSE is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Children and Families and it assists state governments in operating and managing their child-support programs.  Additional Information: The Administration for Children and Families, a division of the Department of Health & Human Services Subcategory: Refund Inquiries Category: IRS Procedures Can I change my bank account information after I filed my tax return?   Answer: You can’t change your bank account information once we’ve posted your tax return to our system.  Subcategory: Refund Inquiries Category: IRS Procedures"
